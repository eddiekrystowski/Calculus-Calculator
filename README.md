# Calculus Calculator #
Hi, thanks for using Calculus Calculator! The two main files of interest here are:
  * script/script.js
  * public/index.html
  
 The first is where all of the Javascript code is that deals with the graphing, data gathering, shading... basically everything. The second is just the layout and style of the page. 
 The rest of the files are just a bunch of stuff that makes the website work and allows us to import libraries (p5js, mathjs, expr-eval) into our project. None of those were written by us, they are automatically generated by the computer and by Glitch whenever they are needed.
 
 ## Glitch ##
 Glitch is what we used to host our website. Glitch gives us a place to host our website and sets up a super basic server that you can then expand upon. This is why our website ends with .glitch.me.
 
 ## Libraries ##
 Doing everything from scratch would have taken more time than we had, so we made use of a couple of libraries. (They just handle the small things so we can speed up development, the whole graphing interface and logic and stuff was still designed by us)
 
 ### mathjs and expr-eval ###
 Algebra and symbolic mathematics is quite easy for humans, but it is a nightmare for computers. This is why, instead of spending all of our time working on this project by attempting to write an equation parser and then failing miserably, we instead used the mathjs and expr-eval libraries to help us out. These libraries take an equation and turn it into a 'tree' which a computer is able to understand like this:

 To put it into perspective, the library that www.derivative-calculator.com and www.integral-calculator.com use is called 'Maxima', and it is millions of lines long. Such a library was beyond the scope of our project and is quite difficult to even use, so we opted for lighter weight libraries that still get the job done.
 
 ### p5.js ###
 p5.js is a handy library that allows you to easily and efficiently draw on a HTML Canvas, which is what the graph is on our website. It simplifies the drawing commands slightly so that they can be implemented faster, and it's super easy to use. This is what allows us to do all of the drawing and shading on the graph.
